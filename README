## CoSciN On a Laptop

This setup emulates the CoSciN network on an Ubuntu laptop.  Technical background and details are at
http://coscin.github.io/website/laptop.html.

To install, start with an Ubuntu-based host.  We've tested on an Ubuntu 14.04 desktop setup with 8 GB RAM.  Then:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/coscin/laptop
```

All of the KVM images will use the same username `ubuntu` with the password preconfigured in the `laptop/install`
script.  You may want to change it to suit your purposes.

The following will run a long time because it grabs the Ubuntu Cloud Server 15.10 image from the Internet (which is about 300 MB).

```
$ cd laptop
$ ./install
$ cd ..
$ source .profile
$ newimg ithaca
$ newimg nyc
$ newimg router
$ newimg bastion
```

The controller VM's `ithaca` and `nyc` need to have the controller software installed on them.  So they must be able to
access the Internet.
